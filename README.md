Project Name: Smith Friends
By: Isabelle Wang

Motivation, brief description of its use:  
There are many events happening at and around Smith. However, many of these postings are scattered around, whether on a bulletin board in Forbes library, on an Instagram posting, or in the Campus Center bulletin board. To make it easier for students at Smith to access events and engage in the community, they can easily access all the events from one organized source. 
Tutorials used: 
Calendar:
The interactive calendar is done using html, css, and javascript which I integrated in my project.
